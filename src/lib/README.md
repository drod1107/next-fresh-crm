# `lib/` Directory

The `lib/` directory contains utility libraries that are essential for connecting to external services and managing core application functionalities. These utilities are used throughout the project to ensure consistency and reliability, particularly in managing database connections.

## Structure

- `mongodb.ts`: Handles the connection to MongoDB.

### `mongodb.ts`

The `mongodb.ts` file is responsible for establishing and maintaining the connection to the MongoDB database. This utility ensures that the application can reliably interact with the database, managing connections efficiently to prevent performance issues.

#### Key Responsibilities:

- **Connection Management**: Establishes a connection to MongoDB and reuses it across the application to minimize overhead.
- **Error Handling**: Includes error handling mechanisms to manage connection failures gracefully.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Utilizes the Singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the database connection is created, even when the application scales.

### Usage

To use the MongoDB connection in your API routes or services:

```typescript
import { connectToDatabase } from '../lib/mongodb';

export async function someDatabaseFunction() {
    const { db } = await connectToDatabase();
    const collection = db.collection('yourCollection');
    // Perform database operations
}
```

The `connectToDatabase` function returns the database connection and the client, which you can use to perform CRUD operations on your collections.

### Configuration

The MongoDB connection URI is stored in the `.env.local` file under `MONGODB_URI`. Ensure that this variable is correctly set to point to your MongoDB instance.
