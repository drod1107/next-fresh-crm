# `src/` Directory

The `src/` directory is where the core functionality of the NextFresh CRM resides. It contains all the essential elements like API routes, pages, components, utilities, and theming configurations. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of each aspect of the `src/` directory to help developers understand and navigate the project efficiently.

## Structure

- `middleware.ts`: Custom middleware for the project.
- `theme.ts`: Configuration file for the application’s theme.
- `app/`: Contains the core application pages and API routes.
- `components/`: Reusable components organized by feature.
- `lib/`: Utility libraries such as database connections.
- `models/`: MongoDB models.
- `types/`: TypeScript definitions.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for operations like file uploads.

## Overall Documentation Strategy

Our documentation strategy for NextFresh CRM is modular and comprehensive. Each level of the project contains its own `README.md` file that explains the purpose, structure, and usage of the files within that directory. This approach ensures that developers can quickly locate relevant documentation based on where they are working in the codebase. The documentation is designed to be accessible to both seasoned developers and newcomers, with clear explanations and minimal jargon.

### Documentation Highlights:

- **Modular Approach**: Each folder has its own `README.md`, making it easy to find specific information.
- **Plain Language**: We use professional terms but minimize industry jargon, ensuring clarity.
- **Step-by-Step Guides**: Detailed instructions for setup, configuration, and deployment are provided at every level.

## Middleware

### `middleware.ts`

The `middleware.ts` file is a custom middleware used to intercept and manage requests before they reach the API routes or pages. In this project, middleware handles tasks such as user authentication, request validation, and route protection.

### Key Responsibilities:

- **Authentication Checks**: Verifies if a user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes.
- **Request Validation**: Ensures that incoming requests meet specific criteria.
- **Route Protection**: Restricts access to sensitive routes, redirecting unauthorized users.

### Clerk Authentication Integration

Clerk is used for authentication in this project, providing user management, sign-in, and sign-up flows.

#### How Clerk Works in This Project:

1. **Sign-In/Sign-Up**: The `auth/sign-in` and `auth/sign-up` pages utilize Clerk's components to manage user authentication.
2. **Middleware Integration**: The `middleware.ts` file checks if the user is authenticated using Clerk before allowing access to protected routes.
3. **Session Management**: Clerk manages user sessions, ensuring users remain logged in across different parts of the application.

To customize or extend authentication, you can modify the middleware or Clerk configuration within the project.

## Theme Configuration

### `theme.ts`

The `theme.ts` file is where the application's visual theme is defined. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, and this file centralizes all theme-related settings.

#### Key Sections:

- **Colors**: Define the color palette used across the app.
- **Fonts**: Specify custom fonts and typography settings.
- **Spacing**: Standardize spacing, padding, and margins.
- **Extend**: Extend Tailwind’s default configuration with custom settings.

### Using the Theme

To use the theme in a component:

1. Import the necessary settings from `theme.ts`.
2. Apply the styles using Tailwind's utility classes or custom classes defined in the theme.

Example:
```typescript
import { colors } from '../theme';

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div className={`bg-${colors.primary}`}>
    <p className="text-white">Hello, world!</p>
  </div>
);
```

## Clerk Authentication

Clerk is seamlessly integrated with Next.js in this project to handle user authentication and management. The authentication strategy is centered around simplicity, security, and scalability.

### Setup and Usage:

1. **Sign-In/Sign-Up Pages**: These pages, located in `app/auth`, are pre-configured with Clerk's authentication components.
2. **Middleware Protection**: Clerk is tied into `middleware.ts` to ensure only authenticated users can access specific routes.
3. **Session Handling**: Clerk manages user sessions, providing robust and secure handling across the app.

## Utilities

### `lib/` Directory

The `lib/` directory contains utility libraries that handle specific tasks such as database connections. The main utility here is `mongodb.ts`, which manages MongoDB connections.

### `models/` Directory

The `models/` directory contains MongoDB models, such as `Contact.ts`, which define the schema for storing contact information in the database.

### `types/` Directory

The `types/` directory contains TypeScript definitions used throughout the project. This ensures type safety and clarity, especially when working with components and API responses.

### `utils/` Directory

The `utils/` directory contains helper functions, such as `s3.ts`, which provides methods for interacting with Amazon S3 for file uploads and retrieval.
