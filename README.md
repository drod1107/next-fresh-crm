## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/next-fresh-crm.git
   cd next-fresh-crm
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Ensure all required packages are installed. If any are missing, they can be installed via `npm`.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are critical for the project to function correctly. Use the `example.env.local` file as a template for your `.env.local` file.

### Required Variables

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string.
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Amazon S3 Access Key ID.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Amazon S3 Secret Access Key.
- `AWS_REGION`: Region where your S3 bucket is located.
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`: Name of the S3 bucket.
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Secret for NextAuth.js.
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: The base URL of your app for authentication.

### Example `.env.local`

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net/dbname?retryWrites=true&w=majority
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket-name
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the Project Locally

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

This project is set up to be deployed on Vercel. Follow these steps to deploy:

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.**
2. **Set up the environment variables** in Vercel using the `.env.local` values.
3. **Deploy the project** using the Vercel dashboard.

Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set in the Vercel dashboard before deploying.

## Directory Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `public/`: Static assets like images and icons.
- `src/`: Contains the application code, including API routes, components, pages, and utilities.
- `components/`: Reusable React components.
- `lib/`: Helper libraries like MongoDB connections.
- `models/`: MongoDB models.
- `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
- `utils/`: Utility functions like Amazon S3 integration.

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the project. The configuration file is located at `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Key Configuration

- **Purge**: Unused styles are purged based on the files in `./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`.
- **Extend**: You can extend the default theme with custom colors, spacing, and more.

## Setting up MongoDB

1. **Create a MongoDB Atlas account** and set up a cluster.
2. **Create a database and a user** with read/write permissions.
3. **Obtain the connection string** and update the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env.local` file.

## Setting up Amazon S3

1. **Create an S3 bucket** in the AWS Management Console.
2. **Configure bucket permissions** to allow your application to upload and retrieve files.
3. **Create an IAM user** with `AmazonS3FullAccess` and generate access keys.
4. **Update the `.env.local` file** with the S3 credentials.

## Packages and Dependencies

Here is a list of critical packages required by the project. They should be included in `package.json`, but ensure they are installed:

- **Next.js**: Framework used for the project.
- **React & ReactDOM**: Essential React libraries.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: For database management.
